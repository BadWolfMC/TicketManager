# TicketManager - Advanced Ticket Plugin
TicketManager is a fully-featured support-ticket Minecraft system designed for both players and staff alike. Designed with an emphasis on flexibility and efficiency, TicketManager strives to be scalable from small towny servers to demanding high-traffic networks, all while remaining as efficient and fast as possible.
